                    The Indian independence movement was a series of historic events and untiring struggle with the ultimate aim of ending British rule in India also known as British Raj. It lasted from 1857 to 1947.

                    It was claimed that “the sun never sets on the British empire”. Well, it did, and a bright new sun arose on the Indian subcontinent. An ancient land and its people shook off the yoke of the empire. 15th August 1947 was India’s tryst with destiny.

                    In hindsight given that our Constitution predates the notion of design thinking (Design thinking was articulated 
                    by computer scientist and Nobel Prize laureate Herbert A. Simon in 1969) and that Constitutions have been infinitely 
                    more defining for entire nations - one can say that the founding architects of our country and the Constitution's 
                    drafting committee were both - prescient and design thinkers of the highest pedigree. To have envisioned, designed 
                    and written a Constitution that has governed and guided a country as diverse as India, its people and institutions.

                India's Constitution is the longest in the world, and contains 1.46 lakh words. The Constituent Assembly (A constituent assembly is a body assembled for the purpose of drafting or revising a constitution), which first met on 9 December 1946, took exactly 2 years, 11 months and 18 days to come up with the final draft. When the draft was prepared and put up for debate and discussion, over 2000 amendments were made before it was finalised.

                The Constitution is a living guide. Those who crafted it wanted it to be in accordance with the citizens’ aspirations and understood the need for amendments. The document has undergone 105 amendments, the last being in August 2021.

                American Scholars Zachary Elkins, Tom Ginsburg and James Melton, in their 2009 book, The Endurance of National Constitutions, contend that on an average, Constitutions have lasted only 17 years since 1789. Constitutions in the post colonial countries that gained independence after the second world war have been fragile. Pakistan cited as an example has had three different constitutions and extended periods of administration without any constitution. From amongst the 12 countries in Asia that gained independence post the 2nd World War and drafted Constitutions, only three survive today. Constitutions of India, Taiwan and South Korea.

                They attribute this to its ability to embody a principle of accommodation, suggest Elkins, Ginsburg and Melton of The Endurance of National Constitutions.
